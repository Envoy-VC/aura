## Getting Started ðŸš€

To get started with Arkway, the first step is to clone the GitHub repository. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Envoy-VC/aura.git
```

Next, you'll need to install the project's dependencies. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

Before running the dev server, you'll need to set up some environment variables. These variables include:

1. `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID` - Obtain your Wallet Connect API key from https://cloud.walletconnect.com/app
2. `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY` - This key enables Aura to fetch ENS Profiles. Get your Alchemy API key from https://dashboard.alchemy.com
3. `NEXT_PUBLIC_XMTP_ENVIRONMENT` - Set the XMTP environment variable to either '_production_,' '_dev_,' or '_local_.' By default, it is set to '_production_.'

Great! You're almost ready to start using Arkway. The last step is to start the development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```
